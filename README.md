42 - AI Snake Game


## Introduction
This project explores reinforcement learning (RL) through a classic game: Snake. Instead of a human controlling the snake, an intelligent agent learns how to play by interacting with a 10×10 board, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. Over time, the agent improves its strategy, aiming to survive as long as possible and grow the snake to a length of at least 10.
